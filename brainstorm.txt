Light engine complete, just requiring finalized animation sequences.
 - Like the idea of making the cast effect reflect the spell.

Control engine:
  - Button based input
    - Hall effect?
    - Micro switch if not.
  - Haptic based feedback
    - Motor appears to run best at 3.3V, can drive from Arduino.
    - Can I use an output pin set to high/low to sink the current?
    - Use transistor if not.
  
  Basic flow:
  
  init()
  {
    set up inputs and outputs
    set up wireless communication
    set up initial system state (off)
    set up initial queued action (none)
    set up initial next action (none)
  }
  
  main()
  {
    check for button input
    if (button input)
    {
      if (queued action button)
      {
        queue action in variable
        send haptic pulse
      }else if (action button)
      {
        if (queued action)
        {
          run queued action
        }else
        {
          run default action based on state (ignite or extinguish)
        }
        send haptic pulse
      }else if (clear button)
      {
        clear queued action
        set animation back to idle?  (unless off)
      }
    }
    if (state change)
    {
      send wireless update
      update native display (if any)
    }
  }
  
  States:
    state_off
    state_idle
    state_cast (lasts until activation button released, then goes to spell)
    state_bigcast (lasts until activation button released, then goes to bigspell)
    state_spell
    state_bigspell
    state_limitcast (lasts until activation button released, then goes to limitspell)
    state_limitspell
