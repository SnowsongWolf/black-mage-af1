# black-mage-af1
The Black Mage AF1 costume project

This project will consist of the schematics and code for running both the Black Mage hat/coat as well as the Stardust Rod.  This project is optimized for a stage performance but may incorporate a simulation mode in the future allowing for effects to emulate the game mechanics.

The staff will be based on an Arduino Micro utilizing 3 Buckpucks to drive 3 high power RGB LED assemblies allowing for full color control.  The hat will be based on an Arduino Duo utilizing 6 8-bit shift registers to control 16 standard power RGB LEDs.  This system will initially only allow for 7 colors (3 primary, 3 secondary, white) but in the future may work with a larger color range.  The hat will also control the "black mage eye" which has yet to have operation modes determined.

The staff and hat will communicate with each other via 2.4GHz wireless.  Input will be provided by multiple hall effect switches.  The unit will be powered by USB rechargable battery packs.  The staff will consist of 3 stick-style packs contained in the handle.  The hat will contain a single yet-to-be-determined battery pack located either in the hat or an internal pocket in the coat.
